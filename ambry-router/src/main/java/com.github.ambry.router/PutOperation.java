/**
 * PutOperation class is responsible for maintaining the state associated with a put operation, and completing it.
 * The associated object of a put operation ends up as one or more chunks, depending on its size. If the size is less
 * than max put chunk size, then the operation will involve a single chunk. Those that are larger are split into
 * multiple chunks and distributed across partitions individually. Each chunk will be a blob at the server and will
 * have its own blob id. For such composite blobs, an associated metadata chunk will be created that consists of
 * the blob ids of every data chunk; and the blob id of this metadata chunk will become the blob id of the overall
 * object.
 *
 * For simple blobs (blobs that are under the max put chunk size), only a single chunk is created and held
 * within a single PutChunk object which is used to complete the whole operation. No metadata chunks are created. The
 * blob id of the single data chunk will be the blob id of the blob.
 *
 * For composite blobs, a PutOperation consists of a fixed number of PutChunk objects and a MetadataPutChunk object.
 * Each PutChunk holds one of the chunks of the object at any time and attempts to put the chunk successfully, and then
 * possibly moves on to hold another chunk of the object. This is repeated until either the operation fails or until all
 * the chunks are put successfully. If all the chunks are put successfully, the MetadataPutChunk is created to put
 * the metadata chunk consisting of the blob ids of all the data chunks, and the successful put of the metadata
 * chunk successfully completes the operation.
