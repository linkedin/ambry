For initial clustermap:
TODO: Run with test coverage to assess how much more testing is required.
TODO: More unit tests; separate unit tests for public interface from detailed interface (i.e., replicaId vs replica)

For tools:
TODO: Better partition allocation tool. Currently, simple hacks included as ClusterMapManager.allocatePartitions

For V1
TODO: Implement Ints.checkedCast(index) or depend on Guava. See ClusterMapManager.getWritablePartitionIdAt
TODO: Document JSON format by defining json schema for HardwareLayout and PartitionLayout.

Beyond V1
TODO: Support for lists larger than int. See ClusterMapManager.getWritablePartitionIdAt
