For V1
TODO: Switch from thread-based implementation to asynchronous implementation on top of Netty. Motivating use case is performance and resource exhaustion in face of one slow data node.
TODO: Remove ttl value from cancelTTL request; rename TTLRequest/Response to CancelTTLRequest and CancelTTLResponse.
TODO: Get unit test dependency correct st ClusterMap.TestUtils can be used to construct test ClusterMap objects.
TODO: Add more unit tests
TODO: Run with test coverage to assess how much more testing is required.
TODO: Add retry loop to PutOperation that "slips" to another PartitionID for new writes (in some cases). This will introduce risk of leaking space since original blobid for original partition is never returned out of the system. Ideally, such blobids need to be logged and lazily deleted.
TODO: add check for read-only replica to server and then add Replica_Not_Writable to server error code and handle error in PutOperation. May need to "slip" partitions to deal with this exception.
TODO: Add getBlobInfo (i.e., gets BlobProperties plus BlobUserMetadata) to Ambry API.
TODO: Safer cast idiom? There are a number of "(int)longValue" casts in the code.
TODO: Better handling of "corrupt" data for get operations. Coordinator cannot differentiate network corruption or other message format issues from datanode-side on-disk corruption. Only datanode can tell if its local copy is corrupt. Either coordinator can demand datanode verifies data before returning it, coordinator can demand a specific blobid be scrubbed, or we wait on scrubbing to detect/document/fix.


MessageFormatFlags:
TODO: MessageFormatFlags is an obtuse name. Need a better name and/or clearer Javadoc
TODO: Add 'BlobInfo' enum to cover use case of retrieving BlobProperties & BlobUserMetadata
