/**
 * BlobStorageService defines a service that forms the bridge b/w a RESTful frontend and a storage backend (or something
 * that communicates with a storage backend).
 * <p/>
 * Typically, a BlobStorageService is expected to receive requests from the RESTful frontend, handle them as required
 * and either send a response (if immediately available) or pass control to another component that does further handling
 * and generates a response. The information received from the scaling layer should be enough to perform these
 * functions.
 * <p/>
 * Most operations are performed async and responses are therefore queued asynchronously instead of being available at
 * the end of the function call.
 * <p/>
 * Implementations are expected to be thread-safe.
