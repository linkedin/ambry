/**
 * The RestResponseChannel is meant to provide a {@link NioServer} implementation independent way to return responses
 * to the client. It deals with data in terms of bytes only and is not concerned with different types of data that might
 * need to be returned from the {@link BlobStorageService}.
 * <p/>
 * This functionality is mostly required by implementations of {@link BlobStorageService} since they are agnostic to
 * both the REST protocol being used and the framework used for the implementation of {@link NioServer}.
 * <p/>
 * Typically, the RestResponseChannel wraps the underlying network channel and the APIs of the NIO framework to return
 * responses to clients.
 * <p/>
 * Implementations are expected to be thread-safe but use with care across different threads since there are neither
 * ordering guarantees nor operation success guarantees (e.g. if an external thread closes the channel while a write
 * attempt is in progress) - especially with concurrent writes.
