/**
 * Construct to support end-to-end metrics tracking based on request type. Usually accompanies a single
 * {@link RestRequest} i.e. there is a one-to-one mapping b/w a {@link RestRequest} and a RestRequestMetricsTracker
 * instance.
 * <p/>
 * A brief description of how the tracker works :-
 * 1. When an object of type {@link RestRequest} (request) is instantiated, it is also expected to be associated with a
 *    unique instance of RestRequestMetricsTracker (tracker). This unique instance is returned on every call to
 *    {@link RestRequest#getMetricsTracker()}. Therefore there is one-to-one mapping between an instance of
 *    {@link RestRequest} and an instance of RestRequestMetricsTracker.
 * 2. When the tracker is instantiated, the type of the request is usually not available. Therefore, the
 *    {@link RestRequestMetrics} (metrics) object associated with the tracker tracks "unknown" requests.
 * 3. As the request passes through the NIO framework and the scaling framework, metrics associated with these layers
 *    are tracked and stored but not updated in the metrics object.
 * 4. When the request reaches the {@link BlobStorageService}, it is usually identified as a specific type and a custom
 *    metrics object that tracks that specific type of request is "injected" into the tracker associated with the
 *    request.
 * 5. When the response for the request is complete and the request is "closed", the metrics that are stored are
 *    updated in the metrics object (injected or default).
