/**
 * Represents a NIO (non blocking I/O) server. Responsible for all network communication i.e. receiving requests
 * and sending responses and supports doing these operations in a non-blocking manner.
 * <p/>
 * A typical implementation of a NioServer will handle incoming connections from clients, decode the REST protocol
 * (usually HTTP), convert them to generic objects that the {@link BlobStorageService} can understand, instantiate a
 * NioServer specific implementation of {@link RestResponseChannel} to return responses to clients and push them down
 * the pipeline. The NioServer should be non-blocking while receiving requests and sending responses. It should also
 * provide methods that the downstream can use to control the flow of data towards the {@link BlobStorageService}.
