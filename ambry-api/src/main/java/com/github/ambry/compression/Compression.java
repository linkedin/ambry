/**
 * Compression interface that provides compression and decompression feature.
 * It supports composite/shared memory where caller manages the buffer allocation.
 * It also supports simple APIs that lets the implementation allocate memory from Java heap.
 *
 * Shared buffer APIs (caller management memory).
 *   Compression example:
 *     byte[] originalData = ...;
 *     int compressedBufferSize = Compression.getCompressBufferSize(originalData.length);
 *     byte[] compressedBuffer = new byte[compressedBufferSize];
 *     int compressedSize = Compression.compress(originalData, 0, originalData.length,
 *                                   compressedBuffer, 0, compressedBuffer.length);
 *
 *   Decompression example:
 *     byte[] compressedBuffer = ...;
 *     int originalDataSize = Compression.getDecompressBufferSize(compressedBuffer, 0, compressedBuffer.length);
 *     byte[] originalData = new byte[originalDataSize];
 *     int decompressedSize = Compression.decompress(compressedBuffer, 0, compressedBuffer.length,
 *                                   originalData, 0, originalData.length);
 *
 * Dedicated buffer APIs (implementation allocate memory).
 *   Compression example:
 *     byte[] originalData = ...;
 *     Pair&lt;Integer, byte[]&gt; compressedBuffer = Compression.compress(originalData);
 *
 *   Decompression example:
 *     byte[] compressedBuffer = ...;
 *     byte[] originalData = Compression.decompress(compressedBuffer);

  /**
   * Get the unique compression algorithm name.
   * The name should be short and cannot exceed max size specified in CompressionFactory.
   * The recommended format is Algorithm Name plus the starting version, such as "LZ4_2".
   * Although storing the name as a string takes more bytes than an integer, it's for readability
   * reason in case we need to manually recover data.
   *
   * *********** IMPORTANT/WARNING **********
   * For backward compatibility, NEVER change the algorithm name, even if there is a typo.
   * The name is stored in the compressed data and will be used to automatically locate the
   * decompression algorithm.  If the name has changed, it will fail to find the decompression algorithm.
   *
   * If you're adding a new compression algorithm, use a new unique algorithm name.
   * If you're upgrading the compression library:
   * - use the same name if the upgraded version's decompress() method supports previous version compressed data.
   * - use a new name if the upgrade version's decompress() method does not support previous version compressed data.
   *
   * Example of compatible upgrade:
   *   Say today we use LZ4 1.8 and its name is "LZ4".  One year later, LZ4 1.9 is available.
   *   Since LZ4 1.9 decompress() method supports decompressing LZ4 1.8 and 1.9, leave the name unchanged as "LZ4"
   *   and just upgrade the LZ4 library to 1.9.
   *
   * Example of incompatible upgrade:
   *   Say today we added LZ4 1.8 and its name is "LZ4".  One year later, LZ4 2.0 is released, but LZ4 2.0 is
   *   incompatible with 1.8.  That means LZ4 2.0 cannot data compressed with L4 1.8.
   *   In this case, introduce a new name like "LZ4_2" while keeping LZ4 1.8.
   *
   * @return A unique name of this compression algorithm.
