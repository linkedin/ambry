/*
 * The token persist logic ensures that a token corresponding to an entry in the store is never persisted in the
 * replicaTokens file before the entry itself is persisted in the store. This is done as follows. Objects of this
 * class maintain 3 tokens: tokenSafeToPersist, candidateTokenToPersist and currentToken:
 *
 * tokenSafeToPersist: this is the token that we know is safe to be persisted. The associated store entry from the
 * remote replica is guaranteed to have been persisted by the store.
 *
 * candidateTokenToPersist: this is the token that we would like to persist next. We would go ahead with this
 * only if we know for sure that the associated store entry has been persisted. We ensure safety by maintaining the
 * time at which candidateTokenToPersist was set and ensuring that tokenSafeToPersist is assigned this value only if
 * sufficient time has passed since the time we set candidateTokenToPersist.
 *
 * currentToken: this is the latest token associated with the latest record obtained from the remote replica.
 *
 * tokenSafeToPersist <= candidateTokenToPersist <= currentToken
 * (Note: when a token gets reset by the remote, the above equation may not hold true immediately after, but it should
 * eventually hold true.)
