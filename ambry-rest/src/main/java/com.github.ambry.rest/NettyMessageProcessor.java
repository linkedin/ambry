/**
 * Inbound request handler for Netty.
 * <p/>
 * It processes a request (in parts) by converting it from Netty specific objects ({@link HttpObject},
 * {@link HttpRequest}, {@link HttpContent}) into {@link RestRequest}, a generic request object that all the RESTful
 * layers can understand and passes it down the pipeline to a {@link BlobStorageService} through a
 * {@link RestRequestHandler}.
 * <p/>
 * It also maintains three pieces of state: -
 * 1. {@link RestRequest} representing the request - This is required since {@link HttpContent} that arrives
 * subsequently has to be available for reading through the read operations of {@link RestRequest}. This is a Netty
 * specific implementation, {@link NettyRequest}.
 * 2. {@link RestRequestHandler} that is used to handle requests - This is optional but the same instance of
 * {@link RestRequestHandler} is used for the lifetime of the channel.
 * 3. {@link RestResponseChannel} - An abstraction of the network channel that the underlying layers can use to reply to
 * the client. This has to maintained at least per request in order to inform the client of early processing exceptions.
 * (exceptions that occur before the request is handed off to the {@link RestRequestHandler}). This is a Netty specific
 * implementation, ({@link NettyResponseChannel}).
 * <p/>
 * Every time a new channel is created, Netty creates instances of all handlers in its pipeline. Since this class is one
 * of the handlers, a new instance of it is created for every connection. Therefore there can be multiple instances of
 * this class at any point of time.
 * <p/>
 * If there is no keepalive, a channel is created and destroyed for the lifetime of exactly one request. If there is
 * keepalive, requests can follow one after the other. But at any point of time, only one request is actually "alive"
 * in the channel (i.e. there cannot be multiple requests in flight that are being actively served on the same channel).
